# Goobi viewer - Indexer
> Indexing application as part of the highly flexible digital library framework - made by the Goobi developer team

## Indexer for the digital library framework
The Goobi viewer indexer is responsible for indexing metadata files and related content files for the Goobi viewer. It parses provided metadata files (e.g. METS and LIDO) to fill the Solr search index with all relevant information. Additionally all fulltext files are read and indexed to allow a fulltext search in the Goobi viewer.

## Documentation
A complete documentation of the Goobi viewer can be found using this URL:

Please notice that the Goobi viewer was formerly known as proprietary software under the name 'intranda viewer' and is released under an open source license since June 2017. Lots of our documentation and description sites still have to be updated to represent the new product name 'Goobi viewer'.
